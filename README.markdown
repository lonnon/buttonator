# Buttonator: Create text images for buttons

This project is a simple tool for making text images to go on buttons
in a touchscreen cash register system. It's a complete unitasker,
but could serve as the base for something that allows more options, such
as different fonts, image sizes, and other goodness.

## Requirements

Buttonator requires the following gems to be installed:

* [RMagick](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/)
* [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com)
* [HAML](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/)
